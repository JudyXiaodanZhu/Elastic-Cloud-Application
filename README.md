# Elastic Cloud Application

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop an EC2 autoscaler that, in combination with AWS LBS, can self provision resources based on CPU usage. \
\
An application called Photo Gallary is developed to test the elasticity of the autoscaler. The Photo Gallary app allows users to upload images and make three transformations to the image: flop, rotate and change gradient.

## Views
The autoscaler has a Manager UI which let users monitor the active nodes and their average CPU utilization. Users can also manage resources manually by adding or removing EC2 instances based on user-set conditions.
